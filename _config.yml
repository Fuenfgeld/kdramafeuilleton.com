podcast-description: "Two friends casually discuss and review K-Dramas from a leftie politics and historical-societal perspective. Max is a current PhDer in Korean Studies, while Celi holds a Master's in Modern Middle Eastern Studies. They met during a field trip to St Petersburg during their history undergrad and immediately bonded over their shared interest in all things Korean and all things history. There will be much laughter and banter, some legit stanning and swooning over all the gorgeous actors and of course some serious historical, political, societal, and fashion analysis by both of them. Some episodes will feature special guests ranging from music experts giving some analysis on OST and fashion specialists to Marxist economists penetrating through the swoony superstructure. Everything will be addressed and everything will be rooted in a shared and steadfast love for K-Dramas."
