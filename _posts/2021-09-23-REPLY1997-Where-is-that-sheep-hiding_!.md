description: Helloo lovely listeners, we&apos;re back! We hope you didn&apos;t miss us last week, but out of scheduling and quality concerns we decided to release our episodes every two weeks instead of every week.Now in this episode we are reviewing the classic k-drama &quot;Reply 1997&quot;. We are discussing the depiction of queer characters in this drama, as well as very shady grooming practices by older men, and more generally identity struggles of teenagers. Enjoy everyone! PS We always love to hear from you - you can reach us via twitter, facebook, or directly through our email kdramafeuilleton@gmail.comLots of k-drama love from Maksu and Celi
