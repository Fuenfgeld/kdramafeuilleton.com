description: K-DRAMA FEUILLETON PODCAST X HALLYUREVIEWSSPECIAL COLLABORATIONWe are so psyched about this episode because it’s a special collaboration with Lina from (you guessed it right!!) HallyuReviews, the coolest blog around, bringing you all the goss and updates on all things K. https//hallyureviews.wordpress.com/Twitter @hallyurevIn this special collaboration episode Lina, Maksu and I are discussing a very common K-drama trope, namely the “met-your-true-love-as-a-child” trope. Have you ever felt a sense of despair realising that your life partner wasn’t among your childhood friends after watching a k-drama? If so you’ve come to the right place and also you’re not alone… You can look forward to lots of banter around the childhood trope and Maksu’s Freudian analysis of it.Let’s dive right in shall we?
