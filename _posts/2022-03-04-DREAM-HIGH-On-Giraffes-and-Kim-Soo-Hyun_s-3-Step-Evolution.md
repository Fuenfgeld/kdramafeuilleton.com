description: TW: Abuse and Rape Firstly let me apologise for being a day late but yesterday, just as I was about to upload this episode, any podcasters worst nightmare happened and everything suddenly got deleted and hours of editing work just disappeared into the ether. After the breakdown that ensued I needed a small break from editing. But thanks to all your support and compassion I managed to edit everything again and so here it is our episode for this week where  Maksu and I are taking a break from all the shiny new kdrama productions and give some well deserved love to a k-drama classic, namely: DREAM HIGH! Maksu and I try and (let’s be honest fail) to give a concise overview of the plot and all characters involved, which is to be fair quite an impossible endeavour. Beyond that we discuss problematic power dynamics that are prone to abuse in the creative industries, we discuss activism around body image and Kim Soo Hyun&apos;s 3-Step-Evolution in the drama.Finally there&apos;s a small rant on Prussian cultural imperialism and dialects by me, because why not…Enjoy everyone!
