description: Today&apos;s episode is about Celi&apos;s current obsession namely the very popular and very current drama “Hometown Chachacha”!In the first part Maksu and Celi talk a bit about their week (until 1600 min).In the second half Maksu is interviewing Celi about Homecha, as he hasn’t seen it yet, so if you want to avoid spoilers, you can skip this part (until min 4600).And finally in the third part Maksu and Celi discuss the age old divide between the city and the countryside or the center vs the periphery, in our modern capitalist nation states and the implications of this divide during the Pandemic. But of course they also cover much more important topics such as Kim Seon-Hos and ShinMinAhs dimples, stolen bathroom slippers aaand sourdough bread.Book mentioned Juli Zeh Unter LeutenAll stats are from the worldbank https//data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS
