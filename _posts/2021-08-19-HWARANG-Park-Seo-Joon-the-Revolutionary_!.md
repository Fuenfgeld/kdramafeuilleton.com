description: In this episode Maksu and Celi are reviewing the very well-known historical Kdrama &quot;Hwarang&quot;.After giving a brief summary of the plot (first 10 min), they delve deeper in the historical background of &quot;Hwarang&quot; and discuss a few anachronisms they spotted in the drama. If you wanna know why restaurants, showers and chairs are a bit out of place in the ancient kingdom of Silla and why Park Seo-Joon&apos;s role can be considered pretty revolutionary, give this episode a listen, enjoy everyone!
