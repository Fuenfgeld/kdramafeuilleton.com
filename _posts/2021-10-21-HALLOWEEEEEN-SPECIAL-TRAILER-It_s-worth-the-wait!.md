description: We don&apos;t have an episode for you this week, as we are gearing up for our extraordinary HALLOWEEN SPECIAL, which you can expect next Thursday, 28 October 2021. It&apos;s definitely worth the wait, we promise. Until then we&apos;ll be carving some pumpkins and watching some more kdramas (as always very critically)... Lots of kdrama-love and solidarity from Maksu and Celi
