description: In this episode of K-Drama Feuilleton, Maksu and Celi are discussing the drama &quot;사이코지만 괜찮아&quot; or &quot;It&apos;s Okay To Not Be Okay&quot;. The drama  addresses issues such as neurodiversity, mental health, and family relationships. Most importantly, however, it stars Kim Soo-Hyun as a male lead after a very long break and oh boy, it was worth the wait! Make yourself a nice pot of tea and join Maksu and Celi on their deep dive into the drama and the issues around it. And hey, even Michel Foucault gets a mention!TW suicideOther shows/books mentioned in the episode It&apos;s Okay That&apos;s LoveHwarangMy Love From The StarProducersItaewon ClassPoseYouAtypicalEsther Perel &lt;3 Michel Foucault Discipline and Punish (1975)If you liked this episode, please leave a comment and subscribe to our podcast.
