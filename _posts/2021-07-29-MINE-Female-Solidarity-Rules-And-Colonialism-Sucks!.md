description: In this episode Maksu and Celi are reviewing the Kdrama MINE. They discuss topics, such as motherhood, the stigma around the queer community in Korean society and what colonialism might have to do with it, as well as power relationships between chaebols and their loyal (or not so loyal) servants.
