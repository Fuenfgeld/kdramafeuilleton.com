description: In this episode we are discussing the 2018/19 K-Drama classic Skycastle. Interestingly enough, recent discussions in Korean politics and media focus on the education sector once again, as one politician bribed professors to help his child publish an academic paper that would get her into a good university. One journalist is even using Skycastle as a reference, which highlights the big impact this drama had. In our analysis we focus on the different characters in the ‘castle’ and the education system in Korea but also more in general. Delve into the fascinating world of Skycastle with us. Enjoy everyone!
