description: In this episode Celi and Maksu are discussing different types of masculinities and how they are portrayed in Kdramas. After characterising each type, they move on to reflect more broadly on masculinity and gender in our neoliberal capitalist world toward the end of the episode. Do let us know what you think about the portrayals of masculinity in Kdramas and what makes them so special. You can reach us either, here, over the comment section or on facebook and twitter. We&apos;d love to hear from you!Show notesÂ - Boys over Flowers- Legend of the Blue Sea- Heirs- Prof Efving-Hwang- What is Wrong with Secretary Kim?- She Was Pretty- Miseaeng- My Mister- Itaewon Class- Healer- The K2- City Hunter- Vagabond- Secrets- Chief of Staff- All Reply Series- Cheese in the trap
