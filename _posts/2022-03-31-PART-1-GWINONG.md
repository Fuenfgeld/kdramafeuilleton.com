description: PART 1 In this episode our fabulous guest Snigdha shares parts of her recent research on representation of gwinong / gwichon women and marriage migrant women in the countryside. While many recent shows feature the gwinong women’s return to the countryside in search for a new life and self-fulfillment away from the city, the marriage migrants are largely underrepresented and stereotyped in Korean drama. We mostly discuss the movie ‘Little Forest’’ and the drama ‘Heaven’s Garden’, but many other, (more) recent dramas are mentioned and connections to our former episodes are made for example Hometown ChaChaCha, Squid Game and It’s Okay not to be Okay. Enjoy everyone!Dramas / movies mentioned Little ForestHeaven’s GardenWhere the Camelia BloomsNamchon Over the MountainHometown ChaChaChaSquid Game It’s Okay not to be Okay
