description: In this episode Celi and Maksu are back discussing the representation of after life and supernatural beings in Korean dramas, such as Hotel del Luna, Tomorrow, Uncanny Counter, and Goblin/The Guardian Great And Lonely God. They are pondering over how the after life often seems to be represented as a cooperation or bureaucracy that deals with the fates of souls just like any other product is dealt with here on earth. We also touch upon some philosophical ideas behind concepts of life and death and morality.
